# Xreal Air2 6dof IMU Mod
This page is my attempt to create a custom native interface that uses the onboard Xreal IMU alongside an external 6dof IMU.
The IMU on the glasses has been decoded and an open source API for windows is being created [here](https://github.com/MSmithDev/AirAPI_Windows).

## What I want to do: 
I want to do something similar to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nreal/comments/11eh0nw/experimental_native_windows_api/), but having more options to modify the screen size, distance, and spatial anchoring from the screen (6Dof).
