# Xreal Air2 6dof IMU Mod
Monocular depth estimation for the Xreal Air2 AR glasses.
The IMU on the glasses has been decoded and an open source API for windows is being created [here](https://github.com/MSmithDev/AirAPI_Windows).
This project is heavily inspired by [iVideoGameBoss](https://github.com/iVideoGameBoss/PhoenixHeadTracker) and [OpenTrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack).

## What I want to do: 
I want to do something similar to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nreal/comments/11eh0nw/experimental_native_windows_api/), but having more options to modify the screen size, and distance, from the user (6Dof).
